\section{Additive Manufacturing}
The term ``additive manufacturing'' (AM) can be considered as an evolution of the ``rapid prototyping'' process, used in various industries to indicate a process of rapidly creating a system or part of it before the final release and commercialization (i.e.\ a prototype). However, recently a significant improvement in the output of these processes has shown that there is a much closer link with the final product and the new name of ``additive manufacturing'' has been chosen.

In few words, the basic feature of the AM technology is the possibility to design an object of interest by means of a 3D Computer Aided Design (CAD) software and then fabricate it directly with almost no need of process planning. Though a very complicated process, AM has the advantage to significantly simplify the work of producing complex 3D objects directly from a software project. Other manufacturing process would require a detailed analysis of the object to determine, for example, the order in which each part has to be built and also the assembly phase.

The key principle to understand how AM works is that the object is built layer by layer, where each layer is a thin cross--section of the object itself derived from the CAD data. However, in real world, each layer must have a finite thickness and so the resulting object will only be an approximation of the original (virtual) project.

At its early stage, AM was used to build visualization models for products as they were being developed. From this initial purpose, AM technology greatly improved as knowledge of materials used and accuracy of the process improved as well. When AM is used in conjunction with other technologies to form a process chain, it can significantly reduce times and costs. Furthermore, the possibility to use high--power lasers has meant that desired objects can be directly made in a broad variety of materials, particularly metals and related ones, thus extending the application range.

%Industrial sectors interested in developing/using AM technologies are aerospace, automotive, rapid tooling and biomedical, just to mention a few.

AM technologies have been described as a very revolution in product development and manufacturing. Moreover, results obtained with AM suggest that this technology could actually redefine what we mean today by a ``manufacturing process''. In order to (try to) explain these enthusiastic forecasts, we need to remark what are the advantages of AM technologies. First, we should emphasize again the ``rapid'' character of this process: it is not just in term of time needed to built an object, but all the development process experiences a speedup, mainly because we are using computers throughout. This is possible thanks to the fact that the transfer from the virtual project to the AM machine is relatively seamless and does not require nearly any interpretation of the design intent (i.e.\ knowing what functionality the object should have, which influences the way it has to be built).

Not least important is the reduction of the number of process steps. Despite the possible complexity of objects to be built, an AM process is usually performed in one single step; other manufacturing processes would require a particular sequence of multiple and/or iterative steps to be carried out and even a relatively simple change in the project may require significant modification in the fabrication process and, in turn, the time required increases.

The current research focus of AM techniques is to produce complex shaped functional metallic components, including metals, alloys and metal matrix composites in order to meet the demanding requirements of several important industrial sectors, such as aerospace, biomedical and rapid tooling. For the fabrication of these components to be cost effective and as accurate as possible, three typical laser based processes have been developed: these are \emph{laser sintering} (LS), \emph{laser melting} (LM) and \emph{laser metal deposition} (LMD).



%\section{Manufacturing processes}
%As opposed to conventional machining processes, based essentially on material removal, AM relies on the idea of ``material incremental manufacturing''. Thus, a typical AM process involves a number of steps which can lead from the virtual description of the object to the physical resultant one.

%Starting from the CAD model of the object to produce, the second step is converting the virtual data to a format accepted by the AM machine; nearly every AM apparatus can read from a file format known as STL (``STereo Lithography''), in which the original CAD model is represented in terms of its external surfaces. Transferring virtual data to the machine also means to ensure that the object has the correct size, position and orientation for building. Then, a setup phase must be done: such settings relate to the building parameters like materials characteristics, energy source, layer thickness and timings.
%The next step is the real building phase, which is mainly an automated process. Lastly, the object has to be removed from the machine and sometimes it may require a ``post--processing phase'' before it can be ready to use.

%The current research focus of AM techniques is to produce complex shaped functional metallic components, including metals, alloys and metal matrix composites in order to meet the demanding requirements of several important industrial sectors, such as aerospace, biomedical and rapid tooling. For this class of applications, AM components are actually used as real production parts, with particular microstructural and mechanical properties. For the fabrication of these components to be cost effective and as accurate as possible, three typical laser based processes have been developed: these are \emph{laser sintering} (LS), \emph{laser melting} (LM) and \emph{laser metal deposition} (LMD). Since a variety of metals and related materials can be processed, these AM techniques are regarded as the most versatile. However, laser based AM generally involves complex out--of--equilibrium physical and chemical metallurgical process, in which heat and mass transfer can occur in different modes~\cites{GuReview54}{GuReview55}, sometimes together with chemical reactions~\cites{GuReview57}{GuReview58}.% As supported by several results in literature, 
%The complex metallurgical phenomena that occur during AM processing are both strongly material %(for a powder, this means chemical constituents, shape and particle size, density, flowability) and process dependent. %(e.g.\ laser type and power, spot size, scan speed, powder layer thickness).
%Therefore, gaining a deeper and more detailed understanding of the out--of--equilibrium transformation the material undergoes is necessary to have more control on methods of laser processing, in order to achieve the desired microstructural and mechanical properties of the resultant product.

%Although all laser additive manufacturing processes share the same philosophy of incremental manufacturing, each techniques has its specific characteristics in terms of which materials can be used and processing details (e.g.\ laser type). We shall now briefly underline some interesting aspects about LS and LM techniques, with a more in--depth focus on the latter as it is the main manufacturing process we are interested in.

%\subsection{Laser sintering}
%Firstly, we can distinguish LS and the other two techniques (LM, LMD) by the fact that the latter imply a complete melting of the powder during the process, while with the former the powder undergoes only a partial melting. As a consequence, powder to be processed with LS must have more than one constituent and each with a different melting point. The multicomponent powder mixtures are typically composed of an high melting point metallic component as the structural metal and a low melting point metallic component as a binder.
%The operative temperature is chosen carefully between these two different melting temperatures by adjusting laser source parameters.
%In contrast with pure metal powders, prealloyed powders exhibit temperature range where both solid and liquid phases coexist during the process; as laser parameters are optimized, the optimal temperature should be within this range. Densification and consolidation of this semisolid system occur as a results of the rearrangement of particles still in the solid phase by the influence of the capillary forces exerted by the liquid phase. %An important aspect related to laser sintering of prealloyed powders is that it needs a strict control of laser processing parameters to reach the right temperature range in which phase coexistence occurs. However, due to the localised and rapid nature of the thermal cycle during the process, controlling the temperature represents a remarkable difficulty and processing problems tend to occur in using LS; this, in turn, makes necessary the aforementioned post--processing treatments.


%\subsection{Laser melting\label{sub:LM}}
%With \textit{laser melting} (also known as \textit{selective laser melting}) the powder, be it a pure metal or an alloy, is brought far above the melting point.
%Typical issues of LS are absent in the similar technique of \emph{laser melting}, since the powder (be it a pure metal or an alloy) is brought far above the melting point.
%The full melting is made possible by the improvement in laser processing conditions, such as higher laser energy, smaller spot size, reduced layers thickness. One considerable step ahead of LM is the possibility to process also pure non--ferrous metals, such as Ni, Ti, Cu, Al\footnote{Actually, aluminum is subject to other issues related to its high reflectivity and known susceptibility to oxidation.} which cannot be well processed with LS mainly due to their high viscosity.

%Currently, LM is used to manufacture functional prototypes and to build up final parts directly. The tool and mould--making industry is a typical example of a branch producing final parts in small batches. Thanks to its almost infinite geometrical freedom, LM is applied to manufacture tooling inserts with particularly complex shapes that would require too many steps with a traditional techique.

%Medical technolgy is another field exploting the possibility of building through LM an object with almost any conceivable shape. Examples are hip implants or surgical instruments out of titanium alloys as well as dental restorations out of cobalt chromium.

%Some known drawbacks of LM are the requirement of an high power laser as source and the fact that thin powder layer thickness requires longer building times. Moreover, as the powder completely melts and then solidifies again, a large degree of thermal deformation is possible, thus leading to the accumulation of stresses in the resultant products.
%The high temperature gradients which the processed part undergoes during the laser interaction are substantially responsible of crack formation and delamination of produced parts~\cite{Kempen2013} (\cref{fig:stress-formation}).
%These problems are especially prevalent in ceramic materials. Ceramics require very high melting temperatures and have very low thermal conductivity, resulting in very high thermal gradient during the process. Combined with its low fracture toughness, ceramics present a difficult challenge to be used as a material processed through LM.

%\end{figure}

%Another common issue is related to melt instabilities at certain conditions, which can lead to final products with an undesirable degree of internal porosity.

%Another relevant issue typical of LM is the phenomenon called \textit{balling}: it happens when molten metal forms spheroidal beads due to poor wetting of the preceding layer, which in turn is caused by surface tension. Balling is an obstacle to the formation of of continuous melt lines, leading to rough and bead--shaped surfaces. In more severe cases, balling may aggravate subsequent layers formation and cause LM to literally ``jam'' the powder coating mechanism resulting in large metallic drops that extend above the powder bed~\cite{Yap2015}.
%Das and Kruth~\cite{Das2003} have explained that the formation of oxide film on a layer impedes effective bonding with the subsequent one. This is mainly due to the fact that oxide films show poor wettability with respect to liquid metals in absence of a chemical reaction.
%One possible solution to this phenomenon is carrying out the manufacturing process under protective atmosphere, using high purity inert gases.

\section{Present challenges}
\label{sec:challenges}
Issues related to the techniques described in previous sections can be divided in two different, though linked, fields: the first one is from a material science perspective and a second one related to technological--industrial aspects.

%General physical properties of materials that are fundamental to all laser--based manufacturing processes are absorptance, surface tension (and wettability) and viscosity: these are to be taken into account when thinking of design strategies of the target product. 

%The absorptance is defined as the ratio of the absorbed radiation to the incident radiation. AM processes generally involve a direct interaction of powders with laser beams, therefore the determination of absorptance of powders is particularly important, because it allows one to determine a suitable ``processing window'' free of a nonresponse of powder due to an insufficient laser energy input or a pronounced material evaporation due to an excessive energy input.

Among particular properties of interests for all AM processes, there are microstructural and mechanical properties and the out of equilibrium phenomenon known as solute trapping. The first two are of primary importance for AM applications and, at the same time, they represent quite broad classes of materials properties. Solute trapping is of peculiar interest when studying solid--liquid interfaces, especially when dealing with multi-component systems (e.g.\ ternary or more complex alloys).

Mechanical properties of AM processed components are strongly linked to the solidification microstructure. The high--energy laser interaction gives rise to a very fast heating and melting of materials, which is inevitably followed by a rapid solidification on cooling. Laser--based AM processes normally offer high heating and cooling rates ($\sim\SI{100}{K/s}$)~\cite{Wright2006:GuREVIEW166} at the solid--liquid interface, producing a molten pool of quite small size ($\sim\SI{1}{mm}$)~\cite{Childs2005:GuREVIEW167}. Furthermore, the rates of quenching that occur by conduction of heat through the substrate are fast enough to produce a rapid solidification microstructure. Therefore, as a characteristic of AM processed materials, grain refinement is generally expected, due to an insufficient time for grain development and growth.
Moreover, either chemical concentration or temperature gradients in the molten pool may generate surface tension gradient, making the solidification a non--steady state process (due to the so--called ``Gibbs--Marangoni effect''). On the other hand, rapid solidification has the kinetic limitation of crystal growth that normally follows the direction of maximum heat flow. The simultaneous but competitive action of the above two mechanisms, i.e.\ a non--equilibrium solidification nature and a localized directional growth tendency, may lead to a variety of crystal orientations with a short--range regularity~\cite{Becker2009:GuREVIEW157}. Therefore, metallic materials processed by AM may present intrinsic, more or less, anisotropic features.

Another important issue concerning mechanical properties of AM--processed materials is related to the residual stresses (i.e.\ stresses that remain inside a material, when it has reached equilibrium with its environment) that arise in the parts being produced. Residual stresses may impose some serious limitations to the practical use, since they introduce part deformations and/or micro cracks. Moreover, large residual stresses can limit the load resistance of the parts compared to a stress--free state.

%In general, residual stresses are considerably large in parts fabricated in a layer--by--layer fashion. A thorough theoretical and experimental study by Kruth et al.~\cite{kruth+04jmatproctech} has disclosed that the residual stress profile consists of two zones of large tensile stresses at the top and bottom of a processed part and a large zone of intermediate compressive stress in between. The magnitude and shape of the residual stress profile depend on the geometric height of the part, the material properties and laser scanning strategy and processing conditions.

Among material properties the elastic modulus and the coefficient of thermal expansion play an important role in what determines the level of residual stresses.
The elastic modulus is of primary importance when phase transformations take place, as they may be detrimental or beneficial with respect to residual stresses. Normally, the formation of brittle phases during AM may promote stress cracking, whereas some controlled phase transformations may have the potential to reduce or eliminate stresses and deformation.

Laser processing conditions can be tuned to control the presence of residual stresses. For LS and LM processes, the laser scanning strategy has a significant influence on the residual stresses being developed. Normally, the stresses are larger perpendicular to the scan direction than along the scan direction~\cite{Simchi2003:GuREVIEW173}  and a  subdivision of the surface in smaller sectors has been shown to lead to a lower stress value.
